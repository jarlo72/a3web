        Stephen 11-14 - Before we get into things, a brief style guide reminder.
        Comments for communication use your full name, like in this one.
        For comments that need to stick around through the submission, initial and date.
        Please initial and date if you modify someone else's code, unless it's very minor.

        When using this template to create subpages, remember:
        USE SEMANTIC HTML.
        Change the <title> above.
        If you need to modify the CSS of an element for your page (ie, <h1>) make sure you
        use a Class or ID for it, so you don't break everyone else's page!

        Oh, also, for each new page you get to delete all the comments from here - they only
        apply to the template doc, not your individual page.
