Capelin on the Coasts

August 12, 2021

In our company we get to work with many organizations from all sectors, although some contracts stand out to be most memorable. LASD has been working on with the Department of Fisheries and World Wildlife Foundation on a multi-year project to inventory Capelin spawning beaches across the island of Newfoundland. Capelin are small pelagic fish that are the main food source for higher prized commercial fishes and the most charismatic Humpback whale in the late summer in the waters around Newfoundland. Capelin have a peculiar strategy of reproduction that even gave them a claim to fame on the well known BBC documentary series narrated by David Attenborough, Blue Planet. To reproduce the male and female capelin must toss themselves ashore, to lay and fertilize the eggs in the coveted course sand that is ideal for incubation. As you could imagine, this ritual attracts quite a bit of attention from gulls, but also of locals who harvest the fish for dinner and to use as a fetrilizer for their gardens. Thankfully, this show and lure of interested parties, makes this event a great candidate for tracking changes to capelin numbers and spawning times via community science. The WWF has created an mobile app for users to upload locations and times of capelin spawning. Our role at LASD, was to manage the data coming in from the mobile app and provide spatial information on where the spawning beaches are and when the Capelin are spawning from year to year. However, we couldn't help but try and catch a spawning in person. We travelled up the Bonavista Penninsula in hopes to see them, and our team was met with success! A truly rewarding on the job experience to stand amongst so many fish as they get their groove on.
