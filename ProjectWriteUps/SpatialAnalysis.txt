Rare plants are choosy when it comes to rocks...

Crater Lake National Park, Fall 2021

In the Fall of 2021 our team was employed to work with the Crater Lake - National Park Service in Oregon to create and ground truth a habitat suitability analysis of the rare species Webius designanius, a critically endangered species in the state of Oregon. The Crater Lake National Park is a haven for the plant species which thrives on the boundary of several rock types found around Crater Lake. The heterogeneity of rock type around the crater creates the edge habitat the plant requires to grow. From our habitat suitability analysis, park staff and researchers visited sites determined to be possible habitat for the rare species and were able to track down three new clusters of the rare plant. Our work at LASD, has helped to identify key habitat for W. designanius and insure the ecological integrity of the park is maintained.
