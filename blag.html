                            <h5 class="blags">Good Data Saves Lives, July 2, 2021</h5>
                                <p class="blags"> In 2001, a teenager decided to explore a sewer near his house in Ottawa.  
                                    6 hours and kilometers later, he was rescued by Ottawa Public Works and firefighter staff.  
                                    Little did he know that the sewer he descended into is a trunk sanitary sewer that drains 
                                    about ¼ of Ottawa.  The flow was deep and fast and he was swept up in a fast-moving current.  
                                    Since Ottawa has well-designed sewers the flow wasn’t turbulent and he was in no 
                                    danger of drowning.  However, he was in complete darkness and had no idea where he was.  
                                    Luckily for him, City staff have an excellent database and map system of the sewer network.  
                                    Once the call came in that he was missing, staff calculated where he would be based on sewer 
                                    connectivity and flow velocities and he was rescued without a hitch.  A good shower and some 
                                    tetanus shots later, he was back at home.</p>
                                <p> This highlights the need for a robust and reliable database of sewage infrastructure, a matter 
                                that LASD takes seriously because we never know if someone’s life depends on our data and maps.</p>

                                <p class="blagJ"> Travelling widens our perspective and helps develop a different approach to life that can be translated to our career passions. Here at LASD, we believe that change and discovery is a necessary part of life and to do so, we must put ourselves out there, somewhere, in the world. We always encourage our team members to pursue this approach to life and take it beyond work. During the annual West Coast GIS Summit, taking place in the later summer months, the team at LASD had a wonderful opportunity to hit the trails and explore the Columbia Icefields highway connecting Jasper and Banff national parks. As you can tell, this was indeed far from the west coast; a consequence of our team overly enthusiastically taking LASD values to heart. The trip definitely left an impression on our team members, who brought back with them a plethora of awkward yet wholesome selfies, and, consequently, many requests for projects and contracts in the Rockies.
