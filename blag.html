                            <h5 class="blags">Good Data Saves Lives, July 2, 2021</h5>
                                <p class="blags"> 
                                    In 2001, a teenager decided to explore a sewer near his house in Ottawa. Six hours and kilometers later, he was rescued by Ottawa Public Works and firefighter staff.  
                                    Little did he know that the sewer he descended into is a trunk sanitary sewer that drains 
                                    about ¼ of Ottawa.  The flow was deep and fast and he was swept up in a fast-moving current.  
                                    Since Ottawa has well-designed sewers the flow wasn’t turbulent and he was in no 
                                    danger of drowning.  However, he was in complete darkness and had no idea where he was.  
                                    Luckily for him, City staff have an excellent database and map system of the sewer network.  
                                    Once the call came in that he was missing, staff calculated where he would be based on sewer 
                                    connectivity and flow velocities and he was rescued without a hitch.  A good shower and some 
                                    tetanus shots later, he was back at home.
                                </p>

                                    This highlights the need for a robust and reliable database of sewage infrastructure, a matter that LASD takes seriously because we never know if someone’s life depends on our data and maps.

                            <h5 class="blags">Community Science | August 12, 2021</h5>
                                <p class="blags"> In our company we get to work with many organizations from all sectors, although some contracts stand out to be most memorable. LASD has been working on with the Department of Fisheries and World Wildlife Foundation on a multi-year project to inventory Capelin spawning beaches across the island of Newfoundland. Capelin are small pelagic fish that are the main food source for higher prized commercial fishes and the most charismatic Humpback whale in the late summer in the waters around Newfoundland. Capelin have a peculiar strategy of reproduction that even gave them a claim to fame on the well known BBC documentary series narrated by David Attenborough, Blue Planet. To reproduce the male and female capelin must toss themselves ashore, to lay and fertilize the eggs in the coveted course sand that is ideal for incubation. As you could imagine, this ritual attracts quite a bit of attention from gulls, but also of locals who harvest the fish for dinner and to use as a fetrilizer for their gardens. Thankfully, this show and lure of interested parties, makes this event a great candidate for tracking changes to capelin numbers and spawning times via community science. The WWF has created an mobile app for users to upload locations and times of capelin spawning. Our role at LASD, was to manage the data coming in from the mobile app and provide spatial information on where the spawning beaches are and when the Capelin are spawning from year to year. However, we couldn't help but try and catch a spawning in person. We travelled up the Bonavista Penninsula in hopes to see them, and our team was met with success! A truly rewarding on the job experience to stand amongst so many fish as they get their groove on.

                            <h5 class="blags">Hear about our UAV specialist and her most recent survey of the Keeley & Frontier Mines | November 14, 2021 Date</h5>
                                <p class="blags">There’s something really special about being asked to survey the Keeley-Frontier Mine. For starters, it is the most prolific past-producing silver/cobalt mine by average grade per tonne, in Canadian history.  The two mines combined produced close to 20 million ounces of silver and 3.5 million pounds of cobalt, at an average grade of 58 ounces silver per tonne, and 3.5 pounds cobalt per tonne. The most beautiful sample of cobalt the Royal Ontario Museum chose to display is in fact, a sample from the Keeley. 
                                    On the ground at the Keeley however, this legacy is actually difficult to imagine. The mine closed long ago, and nature has reclaimed much of the previously developed area. My guide has recommended I put on my red geologist high visibility vest. “Who needs to see me out here?” I wonder. Within a few minutes we can hear gunshots in the distance. Hunters frequently pass through this area and it’s important to remain visible, lest we get accidentally shot! 
                                    I’m here to take photos, videos, and magnetic readings of the property, as well as complete what is known as “flying the grid” in order to 3D map the property later. It is expected the Keeley-Frontier mine has been holding out on us, with one unexplored vein of silver scheduled for sampling in the fall of 2021. Having a birds eye view is crucial to narrowing down the range of possible areas to sample from. My magnetometer watches for sulphites, and these are indicative of abnormalities in the strata- a perfect place to look closer. 
                                    After a long day of flying, its time to let my drone rest. As the sun sets over the horizon of this majestic property, I admire the quiet of the Keeley-Frontier, a perfectly still pond perfectly reflects the colours of the sky, and I remark to myself that there are no fish in a tailings pond.

                                <p class="blagJ" Id = 'blagj'> Travelling widens our perspective and helps develop a different approach to life that can be translated to our career passions. Here at LASD, we believe that change and discovery is a necessary part of life and to do so, we must put ourselves out there, somewhere, in the world. We always encourage our team members to pursue this approach to life and take it beyond work. During the annual West Coast GIS Summit, taking place in the later summer months, the team at LASD had a wonderful opportunity to hit the trails and explore the Columbia Icefields highway connecting Jasper and Banff national parks. As you can tell, this was indeed far from the west coast; a consequence of our team overly enthusiastically taking LASD values to heart. The trip definitely left an impression on our team members, who brought back with them a plethora of awkward yet wholesome selfies, and, consequently, many requests for projects and contracts in the Rockies.
