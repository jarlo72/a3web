                        <h3>Database Creation</h3>    
                        <h5>Municipal Staff Collaboration 2021</h5>
                        <p> Parks staff from a local municipality approached LASD to assist 
                        them with creating a database of trees within their jurisdiction.  Staff will 
                        use this to create monthly schedules, establish annual projects for urban tree revitalization, 
                        generate budgets, and respond citizen complaints.</p>
                        <p>The LASD environmental team worked closely with Parks staff to 
                        suss out key tree data to collect. A digital data collection form was created for 
                        rapid field assessment.  In the office, staff easily transferred the data into 
                        a custom database.  Parks staff were trained by LASD to update 
                        and query the data.  LASD also designed custom forms and reports so staff can quickly 
                        respond to council requests and questions from the public.</p>
                        <p>Municipal staff were so thrilled that LASD will be retained in 2022 to design additional 
                        databases for other park amenities.</p>

                        <h5>Crater Lake National Park, Fall 2021</h5> 
                        <p>Our team was employed to work with the Crater Lake - National Park Service in Oregon to create and ground truth 
                        a habitat suitability analysis of the rare species Webius designanius, a critically endangered species in the state 
                        of Oregon. The Crater Lake National Park is a haven for the plant species which thrives on the boundary of several rock 
                        types found around Crater Lake. The heterogeneity of rock type around the crater creates the edge habitat the plant 
                        requires to grow. From our habitat suitability analysis, park staff and researchers visited sites determined to be possible 
                        habitat for the rare species and were able to track down three new clusters of the rare plant. Our work at LASD, has helped 
                        to identify key habitat for W. designanius and insure the ecological integrity of the park is maintained. </p>

                        <h5>Keeley and Frontier Mine UAV Survey 2020</h5>
                        <p> Our team of aerial surveyors made an expedition to the Keeley and Frontier mines. They gathered data which were then 
                        transformed into three dimensional maps using photogrammetry. Before drones were more common, mapping of large areas was done using manned aircraft, airplanes or helipcopters. 
                        Drone mapping is a way to do this job cheaper, safer, and with simpler logistics. Furthermore, 3D mapping is an incredible service to try out! Not only 
                        does it allow us to visualize a complex terrain, it allows us to monitor progress of development.</p>

                        <p>In the fall of 2021, LASD had an amazing opportunity at Bark Lake to conduct a closed traverse survey as part of a camp 
                        survey plan. Our team members went out and surveyed 12 traverses and afterwards drafted the survey data to a digital
                        map using AutoCAD Mapping software. After doing so, we discovered our linear error of closure was within a meter and the
                        angular error of closure was less than a degree! Props to our team who conducted this successful survey</p>

                        <h5>British Columbia Dam Optimization Initiative</h5>
                        <p> LASD was responsible for creation of a geolocating service kindly dubbed the "human beaver project", intended to 
                            use Digital Elevation Models to derive stream location and flow. This data was then used to find optimal hydroelectric dam 
                            locations for communities within the Fraser Watershed, for further analysis by hydrogeological engineers. Utilizing ArcGIS
                            Pro's modelling capabilities, the team then built a user interface for input selection and to automate calculations. The 
                            project was a critical success and is expected to assist in improving British Columbia's energy infrastructure.
