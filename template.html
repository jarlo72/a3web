        Stephen's thinking out loud here. The layout here is a scattered mess. To fix it, using semantic HTML as agreed,
        we need a <header> tag for our top. Title, image, etc go in it. Bam.
        
        Then we throw in a <div>. This is where Amanda's columns come in - we put <nav> in the left, <main> in the middle, <aside> on the right.
        See https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp for an example (our layout is a bit different).
        <main> can be divided into <section>s, particularly on our pages that are multiple pages.
            Our pop-out info can go into <details>.

        <footer> goes in the bottom, other tags used as required.
