        <h1>This is the primary header.</h1>
            <h2>These are the main subheaders.</h2>
                <p>Some paragraph styling.</p>
            <h2>Oh look, another h2 subheader</h2>
                <p>Another thing to agree on are the usage of tabs in the code.</p>
                <p>I recently learned that I've been using h tags incorrectly, and saw this tab method
                    as a recommendation to keep yourself and your code organized.</p>
                <p>We need to decide, in the code, on things like tab spacings and comment placement - 
                    before a tag, after, inside, etc <p>
                <p>I'll throw in a mock stylesheet too. Please note, none of my choices for font or
                    colour are any indication of where I feel we should go, I'm literally just throwing
                    this together so we have a starting point.</p>

                <p>Do we want to use semantic html?</p>
                <p>if you haven't used it before, it's basically the option to use descriptive tags
                    for html elements - such as putting your title etc into a tag called header, your
                    navigation bar into a tag called nav, etc. Details and useful image to be found
                    here: <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp"></p>
