Amanda Hunter has more than just her head in the clouds these days! Our UAV pilot and remote image & sensor analyst 
loves to send her robot birds into the sky to measure and record a wide array of landscapes. 
Amanda had her humble beginnings as an internationally published fashion photographer but when she 
nearly died of exposure she joined the LASD option available to her! With an advanced operations UAV 
certification and over 5923 logged flights under her belt,she has the greatest passion for creating and then staring at 
images than anyone weâ€™ve ever met. She looks down on everything from great heights, in the best possible way.
