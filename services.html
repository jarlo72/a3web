        Stephen 11-14 - Before we get into things, a brief style guide reminder.
        Comments for communication use your full name, like in this one.
        For comments that need to stick around through the submission, initial and date.
        Please initial and date if you modify someone else's code, unless it's very minor.

        When using this template to create subpages, remember:
        USE SEMANTIC HTML.
        Change the <title> above.
        If you need to modify the CSS of an element for your page (ie, <h1>) make sure you
        use a Class or ID for it, so you don't break everyone else's page!

        Oh, also, for each new page you get to delete all the comments from here - they only
        apply to the template doc, not your individual page.

                        <h3>UAV and Remote Sensing</h3>
                        <p>Our team collects and analyzes data collected remotely (using satellites, aircrafts and unmanned aerial vehicles) to solve regional, 
                            national and global problems in areas such as natural resource management, urban planning, and climate prediction. Our toolbox is a 
                            wide ranging one including radio detection, radar and lidar, magnetometry, photogrammetry and we collect and integrate all these tools
                             on a client by client basis. We focus heavily on the use of UAV for our data collection as there is a great need for multi-spectral drone 
                             mapping in support of exploration. The Landsat images are compiled at a 30metre resolution, whereas the spatial resolution 
                             of of UAV imagery is down to the cm. UAV solutions allow for faster data collection, with automated workflows, all while being safer to use by our team.  </p>
