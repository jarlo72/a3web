List of things we should check before submission:

1) image sizes - are they scaled down appropriately for the site?
2) redundant CSS - we should meet as a group and go through stylesMain.css like a list and lay claim to whatever
    we actually used, to make sure there's no unused CSS and no redundancy
3) mobile and large-display checks - make sure nothing breaks horribly
4) HTML that is not impacted by CSS
5) Missing or mislabelled closing tags
